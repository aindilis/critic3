(critic3 can use freekbs2 to store/inspect/modify nascent
 relations before they are asserted)

(we could do something interesting, we could allow the user to
 set types for columns, or know the types of the argIsa
 relations.  Maybe make it for Cyc at first.  Select a predicate,
 retrieve argIsa, then allow search for the argisa or something,
 or list them, and allow to look through)
